# Project Summary Report

## Project Overview

The project aimed to develop an Android application using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that allows users to search for images on Flickr and view their details. The application features a search bar for entering search queries and displays search results in a grid of thumbnail images. Users can tap on an image to view its details, including the title, description, author, and published date.

## Key Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can enter text into the search bar to search for images on Flickr based on tags.
- **Thumbnail Grid Display**: Search results are presented in a grid layout, allowing users to browse through multiple images efficiently.
- **Image Detail View**: Tapping on an image opens a detailed view that displays the image, title, description, author, and published date.
- **Asynchronous Image Loading**: Images are loaded asynchronously to prevent blocking the UI thread.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language used for Android app development.
- **Jetpack Compose**: A modern toolkit for building native Android UI.
- **Coroutines**: Used for managing asynchronous operations, such as fetching images from the Flickr API.
- **MockK**: A mocking library for Kotlin used in unit testing.
- **JUnit**: The standard framework for writing and running unit tests in Java and Kotlin.
- **Espresso**: A testing framework for writing concise, beautiful, and reliable Android UI tests.

## Implementation Details

- **Main Activity**: Implemented the UI layout with a search bar and thumbnail grid. Integrated the Flickr API to fetch images based on user queries.
- **Details Activity**: Developed the UI for displaying image details, including title, description, author, and published date.
- **Unit Testing and UI Testing**: Created tests for MainActivity and DetailsActivity

## Conclusion

The project successfully developed an Android application with Flickr image search functionality and image detail viewing. By leveraging Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and modern Android development practices, the application provides a seamless user experience. Unit testing ensures the reliability and correctness of key functionalities, enhancing the overall quality of the app.
